Party API is exposed over a REST interface. All messages are encoded using UTF-8. All requests only support HTTP/1.1, as described in RFC 2616. Normally, all positive responses are returned with HTTP status code 200. In some cases, 400 series error codes are used, those cases are described per request. All 500 series error codes indicate some kind of fatal server error. In addition to standard HTTP error codes the following RP API specific codes are used: 471 - No suitable account of requested type found, but user has some other accounts. 472 - Person should view Smart-ID app or Smart-ID self-service portal now. 480 - The RP API client is too old and not supported any more. 580 - System is under maintenance, retry again later. Whenever an RP session creation request (POST to certificatechoice/, signature/, authentication/) is repeated inside a given timeframe with exactly the same parameters, session ID of an existing session can be returned as a result. This allows to retry RP POST requests in case of communication errors. Retry timeframe is 15 seconds. When the caller wants, it can override the idempotent behaviour inside of this timeframe using an optional nonce parameter present for all POST requests. Normally, that parameter can be omitted. RP API clients are authenticated based on their originating IP-address and relyingPartyUUID protocol parameter combinations. When authentication fails, server responds with HTTP error 401. relyingPartyName request field is case insensitive, must match one of the names configured for the calling RP. The names are limited to 32 bytes in UTF-8 encoding and are displayed to the user in the Smart-ID application. The Smart-ID service reserves the right to add new fields into responses of the current RP API version. Therefore the RP must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response objects at any location within the JSON structure. This section will be merged with Secure Implementation Guide. It is essential that RP client performs all the required checks when connecting to the Smart-ID RP API HTTPS endpoint, to make sure that the connection endpoint is authentic and that the connection is secure. This is required to prevent Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for the authentication and signature protocols. The RP must perform the following checks: Verify the HTTPS connection and the TLS handshake is performed with a secure TLS ciphersuite. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint belongs to the well-known public key of the Smart-ID API. The RP must implement HTTPS key (or certificate) pinning. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint is valid (not expired, signed by trusted CA and not revoked). In case the RP fails to verify the connection is genuine and secure an attacker might be able to launch a AITM attack on the connection and either login as the user or have the user sign a forged document.","title":"REST API details","component":"rp-api","version":"3.0.0","name":"api_details","url":"/rp-api/3.0.0/api_details.html","titles":[{"text":"HTTP status codes","hash":"_http_status_codes","id":1},{"text":"Idempotent behaviour","hash":"_idempotent_behaviour","id":2},{"text":"Interface authentication","hash":"_interface_authentication","id":3},{"text":"API client must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response object","hash":"_api_client_must_ignore_unknown_names_fields_in_json_response_object","id":4},{"text":"RP API endpoint authentication","hash":"_rp_api_endpoint_authentication","id":5}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"The signature protocol ACSP_V1 must be used for authentication.

RP backend makes a request to RP-API to create a dynamic link based authentication or signing session, obtaining security parameters that are necessary for generating dynamic links. This request may either be anonymous (no personal identifier is provided) or non-anonymous. RP starts dynamically creating dynamic links that update each second. The dynamic links are generated in RP backend and forwarded to RP frontend. RP frontend displays the QR codes / Web2App links / App2App links. The user interacts with one of them by either: Opening Smart-ID app and scanning a QR code; Clicking on a Web2App link in a RP webpage, thus opening the Smart-ID app; Clicking on an App2App link in a RP app, thus opening the Smart-ID app. Smart-ID app extracts the necessary parameters and makes a request to the Smart-ID backend to check the integrity, validity and timeliness of the dynamic link. If the request was non-anonymous, it is verified that the provided personal identifier agrees with the actual user’s identity. Backend responds by creating a transaction and returning the transaction data. Signing protocol continues in the usual way (user enters the PIN code). After the signature has been given, the RP receives the success result via the session status endpoint. In the case of anonymous flow, RP learns the identity of the user only at this point (via the user’s certificate). The following diagram describes the dynamic link based flow for the authentication session. The flow for the signing session follows the same principles and has been omitted. When RP backend makes a request to RP API create a new dynamic link based session, Smart-ID server generates and returns the following parameters as a response: sessionID - session ID (RP UUID); sessionToken - unique random value that will be used to connect this login attempt between the relevant parties (RP, RP API, Smart-ID app); sessionSecret - unique random value that should be kept in secret and should be shared only between the RP backend and RP API server. RP then starts calculating and showing the QR image, Web2App link, and/or App2App link dynamically (all those links must be updated regularly with the interval of 1 second). The RP may offer multiple options (a QR image and a Web2App link) to the user at the same time. This is useful in the following situations: The user is accessing RP website from a mobile device, for example a tablet device. RP wants to offer to the user the choice to authenticate either on the same device (via a Web2App link) or on a separate device (via a dynamic QR code). RP is unable to detect from the user agent whether the user is using a mobile device or a PC. The next table lists all of the parameters and definitions used in the dynamic link generation. They are all explained in more detail below. Parameters used for dynamic link generation Parameter Formula sessionToken (generated by RP API) sessionSecret (generated by RP API) dynLinkType 'QR' | 'Web2App' | 'App2App' sessionType 'auth' | 'sign' | 'cert' elapsedSeconds Seconds since receiving the response from the initial request to RP API payload dynLinkType.sessionType.time authCode HMAC(sessionSecret, payload) QR message smartid:sessionToken=..?dynLinkType=..&sessionType=..&elapsedSeconds=..&authCode=.. The parameters for QR, web2app link and app2app link are the same except for the dynLinkType parameter, which contains one of the 3 possible values: 'QR' (for QR codes) 'Web2App' (for Web2App links) 'App2App' (for App2App links) The parameter sessionType describes the session type: 'auth' - authentication session 'sign' - signing session 'cert' - certificate-choice session The elapsedSeconds parameters is seconds since receiving the response from the initial request to RP API. Notice that authCode must be re-calculated every 1s. As the next step, RP calculates: payload := dynLinkType.sessionType.time authCode := HMACSHA256(sessionSecret, payload) Details about formatting the payload and sessionSecret parameters as byte strings for HMACSHA256 calculation: payload should be converted into a byte string from its ASCII string representation sessionSecret should be converted into a byte string from its ASCII string representation (as it is returned from RP-API as an ASCII string) The following table aims to clarify which of the parameters should be accessible by which parties. RP-API server RP backend RP frontend/app sessionId sessionToken sessionSecret elapsedSeconds dynLinkType sessionType authCode Legend: - source of parameter (the party that generates/calculates it) - knows parameter - MUST NOT know parameter QR message itself is defined as the following URI string: smartid:session_token?dynLinkType=QR&sessionType=session_type&elapsedSeconds=elapsed_seconds&authCode=authentication_code Example: smartid:01fbf533-846d-4fc2-8b45-d8871a27912c?dynLinkType=QR&sessionType=auth&elapsedSeconds=2&authCode=R5oiivdJIhfjJLBCA3AzijU2p8oH45fBKpcN59oSXboo Here parameter authCode is represented as a hexadecimal string. Parameter sessionToken is inserted into the QR message exactly as it was returned from RP-API. Example of a QR code: The dynamic link for App2App and Web2App is similar to the QR URI string: https://sk-eid.github.io/?sessionToken=session_token&dynLinkType=dyn_link_type&sessionType=session_type&elapsedSeconds=elapsed_seconds&authCode=authCode Example of a Web2App link: https://sk-eid.github.io/?sessionToken=01fbf533-846d-4fc2-8b45-d8871a27912c&dynLinkType=Web2App&sessionType=auth&elapsedSeconds=2&authCode=R5oiivdJIhfjJLBCA3AzijU2p8oH45fBKpcN59oSXboo For all flows, the dynamic generation (every 1s) of the authCode parameter must be done in the RP backend, NOT in the RP frontend or RP app so as not to not leak the sessionSecret parameter. In the App2App and Web2App flow it will be possible for the RP to also attach a callback URI that the Smart-ID App can call at the end of the transcation. This will allow for seamless navigation between RP apps and RP websites in the same-device use case. Details for the this functionality are being worked on. The callback URL will also be part of the payload and as such protected by the authCode parameter. The allowed callback domains might be whitelisted by the Smart-ID Service. For generation of QR codes, error correction level LOW should be used. The QR code should have sufficient margins to enable quick scanning by the Smart-ID app. The optimal size for QR code is ~10 pixels per block when displayed on a PC, since: Block sizes 5 pixels and less are too small for easy scanning (devices might have focus issues). Block sizes 20 pixels and above are too big for convenient scanning. When QR code is displayed on a mobile device, it is recommended to show the QR code as big as possible, up to 10 pixels per block. The actual generation of the QR image can be done both in the backend or the frontend, as the underlying message in the QR code is essentially public information. In the App2App flow, it is not necessary to generate the link every second. Instead, the RP app can request a fresh link on-the-fly from the RP backend when the user clicks on a button in the RP app and navigate to it.","title":"Dynamic link flows","component":"rp-api","version":"3.0.0","name":"dynamic_link_flows","url":"/rp-api/3.0.0/dynamic_link_flows.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Dynamic link calculation","hash":"_dynamic_link_calculation","id":2},{"text":"QR","hash":"_qr","id":3},{"text":"Link","hash":"_link","id":4},{"text":"Dynamic link and QR presentation","hash":"_dynamic_link_and_qr_presentation","id":5}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"Smart-ID account A person has to register a Smart-ID account to use services provided by the Smart-ID system.

The interface offers the entry point to Smart-ID main use cases, i.e. authentication and signing. The main Smart-ID use case is of a relying party to start a session by calling the Smart-ID server RP API with a challenge when the user wishes to authenticate with the relying party’s service or create a signature. The Smart-ID server either sends a push message notification to the user’s device where the user opens the Smart-ID application or the user must scan a QR code or in case of the same device use case click a link to launch the Smart-ID application. The the user checks the details of the transaction and enters a PIN code to confirm it. The application communicates with the Smart-ID server and once the final signature is created makes it available for the relying party to be fetched. Meanwhile the relying party has been waiting for a reply from the Smart-ID server using a long poll connection. In case of success it receives the signature and the user’s certificate to be able to validate the result. The service creates digital signatures as proof of authentication and signing. However to create electronic signatures the relying party must create the required document structure, calculate the hash and have that signed using this API. The latest version of the API introduces new flows collectively referred to as \"dynamic flows\". for multi-device use cases — dynamic QR codes that the user must scan; for same-device use cases where the user is visiting an RP webpage using a mobile browser — dynamic links which the user must click; for same-device use cases where the user is using an RP app — dynamic links which the user must click. The guiding principle in designing the API has been to unify those three afore-mentioned flows as much as possible to minimise the integration efforts for the RPs. Because of this, they share the same security mechanisms and principles, even though the medium of transmitting information is completely different. This also means that it is possible for an RP to offer alternative methods of authentication at the same time without doing multiple requests to RP-API. This is useful in the following situations: The user is accessing RP website from a mobile device, for example a tablet device. RP wants to offer the user to authenticate either on the same device (via a Web2App link) or on a separate device (via a dynamic QR code). RP is unable to detect from the user agent whether the user is using a mobile device or a PC. In RP API version 3, the notification-based flows will still be available, but they are intended to be used only after the user has been securely authenticated by one of the dynamic flows before. It is up to the RP to decide how often to require the user to perform a secure authentication (minimum recommended is once per 3 months for every device that user owns) in case of the multi-device. The RP should utilize client local storage (cookies) to keep track which clients have previously authenticated using the new flows. For same-device flows the new dynamic links based flows should always be used. Brokers of the Smart-ID service are treated similarly to relying parties and there is no extra configuration compared to previous RP API versions. These changes have not been finalized yet! This documentation is a work in progress.","title":"Introduction","component":"rp-api","version":"3.0.0","name":"introduction","url":"/rp-api/3.0.0/introduction.html","titles":[]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"In RP API v3, VC codes are not generated by RP from DTBS, but are returned from the server to RP. VC codes are only relevant for the notification-based flows. Currently, there is only supported type of VC codes: alphaNumeric4 The returned VC code consists of 4 characters (numbers and upper-case latin letters). It should be shown to the user as received from the server. The primary motivation for the change was the fact that the previous VC code format was too similar for PIN1 code and caused confusion for some of the users. Also, the inclusion of letters improves the number of possible combinations, thus strengthening it as a security measure. This functionality is work-in-progress and this section has not been finalized yet. When Smart-ID is used to perform a transaction on the same device it is installed on (browser or RP app) via the notification-based flows, the push notification can arrive quickly and bring the Smart-ID app into the foreground before the user has had a chance to read the verification code presented by the RP. This is especially pronounced in the Verification Code Choice scenario as the user will not know the correct code when prompted to choose it. The exact behaviour depends on mobile device operating system version, screen state, app permissions and app configuration.

After successful authentication, the RP must invalidate the old user’s browser or API session identifier and generate a new one.

After the updates it will be restructured and integrated into the rest of the RP API documentation. Although ID-card, Mobile-ID and Smart-ID are all secure technologies for authentication and digital signing, e-service providers (Relying Parties, RPs) need to consider potential risks, which are associated with digital authentication solutions. It is important that RPs implement additional security mechanisms to help users to understand the context of their actions and to protect them from possible attacks. For example, there might be a malicious phishing website controlled by attacker between user’s browser and the RP’s website. This document lists attacks that can be launched against RP’s website or RP’s app, when the RP is using ID-card, Mobile-ID or Smart-ID for authentication and digital signatures. Both user interface options (browser and app) are considered and when it is not specifically stated, attacks and proposed countermeasures are relevant for both cases. Effective security measures for mitigating attacks are described in the following sections. Some security conscious RPs have already deployed them. Others should also consider implementing and deploying these measures and defences to prevent cybercriminals from being successful in their actions. Guidelines are written in affirmative and imperative mood, however, not all security measures are considered mandatory for all RPs. Nevertheless, there’s nobody else, who can implement those defences and security measures on their behalf. It is the relying party’s opportunity and responsibility to carefully assess these risks and select appropriate countermeasures. Relying Party (RP, e-service provider) Organisation developing and managing the website and providing some service to its users. The organisation may bear financial losses in case cybercriminals are successful with their attacks. Website (e-service) Information system built by RP and uses Mobile-ID or Smart-ID service to authenticate users and to create digital signatures. The website is integrated with the Mobile-ID RP API (https://github.com/SK-EID/MID) or the Smart-ID RP API (https://github.com/SK-EID/smart-id-documentation). App RP’s mobile application running on a user’s device. The app is used to interact with the RP’s e-service and in the background, the app is communicating to the RP’s backend or website. Users Natural persons with registered Mobile-ID/Smart-ID accounts. Users authenticate to the RP’s e-service and create digital signatures with the browser or the RP’s app. All feedback to this document and proposed security measures is much appreciated. Please send it to the e-mail address support@sk.ee on the Secure Implementation Guidance. This section describes common attacks, which have been tried in the past against RPs, against their users and against SK ID Solutions. Giving a brief overview of the attacks is necessary as it may be the case some RPs are not aware of some of the attacks and may erroneously think they are safe. Also, not all countermeasures are effective against every possible attack. RPs will need to consider, which attacks could have the most devastating impact on their business and therefore, which countermeasures should be deployed first. Attacks are described in a generic way and don’t differentiate between browser, app, ID-cards, Mobile-ID and Smart-ID. User starts the login process on the RP’s website or app. They enter national identity code, but sometimes make a small error in the code. By random chance the entered incorrect code corresponds to another real person, who also has a Smart-ID or Mobile-ID account. Smart-ID/Mobile-ID system initiates the authentication transaction for the wrong user and the phone of another user wakes up and displays the authentication consent screen. It has occurred in the past the other user accepted the foreign consent dialog without verifying it and without having second thoughts confirmed it by entering PIN1, behaving almost like on auto-pilot. The session of the original user was then authenticated by the RP’s website, although the original user is logged into the wrong person’s account. There was no malicious attempt in the beginning, it was purely accidental error by both users. In this case, an attacker is specifically targeting some particular user. The attacker tries to irritate and to annoy the user by repeatedly initiating an authentication session with the user’s identity. This sends nefarious Smart-ID/Mobile-ID notifications to the user’s phone and disturbs normal phone usage. Attacker could ask for a ransom to cease the attack or simply cause inconvenience as a revenge. In a more advanced situation, an attacker targets the RP itself and starts many authentication sessions with the app or website of RP, using some scripted and automated tools. The attacker could use random usernames and generated national identity codes and this results nefarious notifications on phones of multiple users and disturbs normal phone usage. Not only does this cause inconvenience to users, but also, this kind of attack could result in a large number of complaints to SK ID Solutions and SK could be forced to temporarily cut off the Smart-ID and/or Mobile-ID service to the RP. This results in the outage of the RP’s website or app, because other users cannot login either. Attacker could ask for a ransom to cease the attack or simply cause damage as a revenge. An advanced version of this attack targets multiple RP’s and in such a widespread attack, SK could be forced to temporarily cut off the Smart-ID and/or Mobile-ID service to those RPs, who are not able to filter the malicious authentication attempts by themselves. An attacker is trying to extract and deduce information about Mobile-ID/Smart-ID users through the RP’s website or other information systems or software. For example, the attacker initiates a Smart-ID authentication session on the RP’s website with a generated national identity code. If no error message is returned, the attacker can deduce that this particular user has a Smart-ID account and it may be worthwhile to try some further attacks against that particular user. In more advanced situation, the attacker may be able to use the RP’s information system to download the user’s signing certificate. Phishing attacks are intended to confuse users and to gain access to the RP’s e-service under the user’s name. Usually, these attacks are automated and distributed in large quantities via spam e-mails. The attacker hopes some percentage of users, who are not aware of risks and are not careful, will \"take the bait\" and be \"hooked\". Hence, the name \"phishing\" (fishing). However, e-mail and browsers are not the only attack vector. In case the RP requires digital signatures in order to commit an operation or transaction on the e-service, the attacker tries to further confuse the user and will try to get the user to enter PIN2 for the signing request as well. Previously, phishing has been attempted in a manual (non-automated) ways and with simple (static) counterfeit websites. However, with advances in attack tools, more powerful attackers must be considered. Nowadays, they are able to build authentic looking and well-functioning dynamic websites, which proxy authentic HTML pages and images from the original website of the RP. General steps of such kind of phishing attacks are following: An attacker sends users a phishing e-mail with a URL to the proxy website and waits until the user connects to the attacker’s website. Automatic tools then connect from the proxy website to the original website of the RP. The user enters all the required information (username, national identity code, …​) and starts authenticating on the attacker’s website. The proxy website sends the same information to the original website and starts the same kind of authentication session there as well and mediates back the correct Mobile-ID/Smart-ID verification code and any other displayed information. The user sees the authentication dialog on the mobile device, with correct serviceName, correct displayText and correct verification code. The user will consent to the authentication dialog and enters PIN1, although the attacker’s proxy will be logged in to the user’s account at the RP’s website. After logging in, the attacker’s proxy waits until the user initiates the operation or transaction and changes details of the transaction on the fly (for example, change the destination bank account number of the transfer order) and starts the changed transaction on the original website. The user enters the PIN2 to confirm the transaction, but it will be the attacker’s changed transaction that will be executed. An attacker makes a phone call to a user, posing as an employee of the RP (or some other authoritative person, for example, police officer) and persuades the user that they need to perform a Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication in order to confirm something fictional. General steps of such kind of phishing attacks are following: An attacker gathers the required information (username, national identity code, …​) from the user or has already them at hand before the phone call. The attacker navigates with the browser to the RP’s original website and starts the authentication session under the name of the user. Website initiates the Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication and displays the verification code to the attacker. (Instead of the website, the attacker could use the RP’s app as well.) The attacker informs the user that Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication needs to be performed and tells them the verification code and asks to complete the authentication on the mobile device. The user verifies the authentication dialog on the device, consents and enters PIN1. The Browser of the attacker is logged into the RP’s website under the user’s identity. The attacker starts an operation (for example, a transfer order) on the RP’s website. The website initiates the Mobile-ID/Smart-ID digital signature operation and displays the verification code to the attacker. The attacker informs the user, still on the phone call, that Mobile-ID/Smart-ID digital signature needs to be created as well, and tells them the verification code and asks to complete the signing operation on the mobile device. The user verifies the digital signature dialog on the mobile device, consents and enters PIN2. The operation on the website of the RP is executed. This section lists security measures, which can be deployed by the RP itself in order to protect from threats and attacks listed in the previous section. This table describes proposed security measures. It includes the following information: In case the proposed security measure is considered mandatory for customers of SK ID Solutions, it is marked as \"MUST\". In case it is recommended, it is marked as \"SHOULD\". Information whether the security measure can be applied to websites and/or apps. Most of the measures are universal, but there are specific measures, such as \"keeping track of trusted browsers\" that apply only in certain situations. Information whether the security measure can be applied in case of ID-card, Mobile-ID and/or Smart-ID integration.

RP must implement the following checks and controls. Using simple means just to include a number of CA certificates in the TLS server configuation is not enough. SK ID Solutions uses many CAs and TLS server needs information about them all in order to build trust chains. However, not all of the CAs are used to issue ID-card certificates and this information needs to be manually added. It is important to explicitly specify, which CA-s are trusted to issue the certificates for the CCA authentication and which CAs are not trusted to do that. For example the OpenSSL utility can be used for that: cd /path/to/trusted_certificates_directory/ wget https://c.sk.ee/EE-GovCA2018.pem.crt wget https://www.sk.ee/upload/files/EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA.pem.crt wget https://c.sk.ee/esteid2018.pem.crt ... openssl x509 -addreject clientAuth -trustout -in EE-GovCA2018.pem.crt -out EE-GovCA2018_trusted.pem.crt openssl x509 -addreject clientAuth -trustout -in EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA.pem.crt -out EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA_trusted.pem.crt openssl x509 -addtrust clientAuth -trustout -in esteid2018.pem.crt -out esteid2018_trusted.pem.crt ... rm EE-GovCA2018.pem.crt rm EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA.pem.crt rm esteid2018.pem.crt Note that it is important to include the certificate of root CAs and implicitly configure clientAuth reject for them. When configuring Apache in this way, it is also neccessary to use the SSLCADNRequestPath directive, which specifies the list of acceptable CA-s, which are sent to the client over the TLS handshake. cd /path/to/client_request_CAs_directory/ wget https://c.sk.ee/esteid2018.pem.crt openssl rehash /path/to/client_request_CAs_directory/ After specifying trust settings for individual certificates, allow TLS server to only trust these CAs and to request specific certificates from clients (configuration example is given for Apache mod_ssl): #... SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile ... SSLCertificateKeyFile ... SSLCACertificatePath /path/to/trusted_certificates_directory/ SSLCADNRequestPath /path/to/client_request_CAs_directory/ #... Web-EID provides authentication using a custom protocol instead of TLS CCA. When implementing it adhere to the requirements and configuration outlined in the documentation. Web-eID validation libraries handle correct verification of ID-card certificates on your behalf. Keeping the Web-eID software libraries updated is critical. https://web-eid.eu/ SK Identity Solutions provides OCSP service to check for the validity of issued certificates. More details are available at https://www.skidsolutions.eu/en/services/validity-confirmation-services/ Configuration example is given for Apache mod_ssl: #... SSLEngine on SSLOCSPEnable leaf SSLOCSPDefaultResponder \"http://responder.example.com:8888/responder\" SSLOCSPOverrideResponder on #... It is important to only accept these certificates, which correspond to production ID-cards, Digi-ID and other identity documents. An attacker could present other certificates as well and in some cases this might lead to a vulnerability. Issuance policy is recorded in the certificate extension X509v3 Certificate Policies and contains an OID identifier. Identifier values of issuance policies are listed at the page https://www.skidsolutions.eu/en/repository/CP/ and https://www.skidsolutions.eu/upload/files/SK-CPR-ESTEID2018-EN-v1_2_20200630.pdf. Following table compiles a helpful list of policies relevant to accept in the TLS-CCA authentication sessions.

RP would need to export the full client certificate from the TLS session to the application server and then apply filtering with PHP or other applications. Configuration example with Apache mod_ssl: #... SSLEngine on #... SSLOptions +ExportCertData #... and source code example with PHP: $cert = getenv('SSL_CLIENT_CERT'); $x509 = openssl_x509_parse($cert); $certificatePolicies = 'Policy: 1.3.6.1.4.1.51361.1.1.1'; if(preg_match(\"/$certificatePolicies$/m\", $x509['extensions']['certificatePolicies']) == 0) { echo \"OK\\n\"; } Note that demo code examples only use a single OID value. Production systems would have to use the whole table. It is important to only accept these certificates, which have the \"TLS Web Client Authentication\" extension and are issued by trusted CAs. Partial configuration example for Apache: #... Require expr \"TLS Web Client Authentication, E-mail Protection\" in PeerExtList('extendedKeyUsage') #... and partial configuration example for F5 BIG-IP loadbalancer: when CLIENTSSL_CLIENTCERT { HTTP::release if { [SSL::cert count] < 1 } { reject } set client_cert [SSL::cert 0] set clientCA [X509::cert_fields $client_cert [SSL::verify_result] issuer ] #If issuer contains \"-SK 20\" assume it is a SK certificate and process further if {($clientCA contains \"-SK 20\") } { if {($clientCA contains \"ESTEID-SK 20\") } { #If issued by ESTEID check if it is mobile-id or not, mobile-ID profile doesn't have TLS web auth enabled if { !([X509::extensions $client_cert] contains \"TLS Web Client Authentication\") } { log local0. \"Invalid certificate used for authentication, IP: [IP::client_addr], Issued by: $clientCA\" reject } } else { #Not issued by ESTEID, shouldn't allow TLS auth log local0. \"Invalid certificate used for authentication, IP: [IP::client_addr], Issued by: $clientCA\" reject } } } serviceName is a short text string, displayed to the user in the Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent dialog. It helps user to verify that the request is coming from a trusted source. serviceName will be displayed on the top of the consent screen, in bold letters. SK ID Solutions have established basic requirements that serviceName should contain one of the following: name of the company, a DNS domain which your website is using, a registered trademark, associated with the website or app, which the user is interacting with, a brand name, associated with the website or app, which the user is interacting with. Generic serviceName, which does not help user to distinguish between different RP-s, are not accepted (such as \"login\", \"authentication\", etc). displayText is a short text string, displayed to the user in the Mobile-ID or Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent dialog. It helps the user understand the context of the operation. displayText will be displayed on the authentication or signing consent screen, under the verification code number. The RP can use this to distinguish between the different information systems or different services within the RP, when requesting the authentication. When requesting a digital signature, the RP can use this to give information about the nature of signature, such as the name of the document to be signed or information about the transfer order to be executed. For example, in case the RP is using Mobile-ID or Smart-ID to authenticate users, who are calling the RP’s helpdesk via phone, these authentication requests must use different displayText than requests sent by the RP’s website. This way the user has greater confidence, that the person on the phone (a helpdesk agent, who might be out-sourced from an external company) is not logging into the website of the RP under the name of the user. With signing operations, there’s also possibility to use much longer and descriptive displayText. For more details, see section Defence: show details of transactions in the displayText. At the basic security level, Smart-ID is using a 4-digit verification code, which is displayed to a user on the RP’s website and on the Smart-ID app. The user is expected to match these and thus verify they consent to the correct authentication or signature request. At more advanced security level, the RP can request the Smart-ID app should display three verification codes (one correct code and two random codes) and the user is required to select the correct code, which is displayed by the RP’s website or app. In case the user doesn’t choose the correct code, the Smart-ID app aborts the request. This can be requested in the Smart-ID RP API call using the verificationCodeChoice interaction type. More information in the API documentation: https://github.com/SK-EID/smart-id-documentation/tree/v2 In case the RP is using an app it is recommended to include a small delay after showing the verification code to user and before starting the transaction on the RP-API. This way, the user has additional time to look at the verification code on the RP’s app, before the screen of the Smart-ID app is displayed. In order to increase trust and confidence in users, it is useful to show details of the last successful session. The RP must prominently display the information about the last authentication, including such elements: Date and time of the last successful authentication. Geographic location (country) of the last successful authentication. Short human readable description of the browser last used for successful authentication (such as \"Chrome on Windows\", \"Safari on Mac\"), deduced from the browser’s user-Agent header. This will help users to recognise the last login details and increase their confidence that nobody else has accessed their account after their last login. If they don’t recognise the last session, the user can contact the RP’s user support and raise the alarm. With password-based authentication systems, it was a good practice (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#authentication-responses) to show same error message for two cases: username was incorrect and the account didn’t exist, and username was correct, but the password was incorrect. This helps to prevent the user account enumeration (WSTG-IDNT-04). With Mobile-ID and Smart-ID services, following the same principle helps to prevent data mining for attack preparation. It also makes some phishing attacks more difficult. Mobile-ID RP API and Smart-ID RP API return different error codes to help debuging: Mobile-ID RP API, HTTP 200, \"result\": \"NOT_MID_CLIENT\" — \"Given user has no active certificates and is not MID client\" Smart-ID RP API, HTTP 404 — \"object described in URL was not found, essentially meaning that the user does not have an account in Smart-ID system\" Smart-ID RP API, HTTP 471 — \"No suitable account of requested type found, but user has some other accounts\" However, it is the reponsibility of the RP not to show different UI messages for those cases, but to follow generic, uniform pattern: Request new authentication session from the Mobile-ID or Smart-ID API with the user identifier. In case the API responded with the new authentication session: Display the text \"Authentication session started, verification code 1234\" with the value of the verification code given by Mobile-ID or Smart-ID API In case the authentication is successful, continue with the login In case the authentication session is timed out after 120 seconds, show the error message \"User account not found or user didn’t responded in time\" In case the API responded with \"NOT_MID_CLIENT\" or \"HTTP 404\" or \"HTTP 471\": Generate random verification code value Display the text \"Authentication session started, verification code 1234\" Wait for 120 seconds and then show the error message \"User account not found or user didn’t responded in time\" Good design of the website should include a way for a user to see the history of their actions. For example when the user logged in, what operations the user has executed, what orders the user has placed and so on. This provides the user visibility and transparency about what is happening on the user’s account. It also provides an opportunity to see actions or operations the user doesn’t recognise and that could point to security incidents. On the other hand, when the user does recognise all the history, it will increase the trust in the website and services of the RP. Also, the RP must allow the user to download digitally signed documents that were created after entering PIN2. This applies to any operation that uses PIN2 for additional consent. For example, after signing the terms and conditions for the e-service or when signing a transfer order on the RP’s website the user must be allowed to download the signed document. This allows the signer to verify contents of the signed document. displayText is a short text string, displayed to a user in the Smart-ID signing consent dialog that helps the user understand the context of the operation. There are two options for the string length of the displayText: short displayText string can be up to 60 characters and it will be displayed as a single line below the verification code, on the same screen as the keypad for entering PIN2. longer displayText string can be up to 200 characters and it will be displayed on a separate screen to gain the user’s attention. In case there’s an advanced phishing attack in progress and an attacker is presenting a modified website to the user, with the modified operation details, such as destination account number of the transfer order, the user cannot detect the attack solely with the user’s browser. However, the string of the displayText is coming directly from the RP and the attacker cannot modify it to deceive the user. This way, the RP can use a secondary authentic channel to allow the user to verify and confirm the operation. A common way to start the Mobile-ID or Smart-ID authentication is to ask for a user identifier, either the phone number or national identity number. However, these numbers are not secret and even though they are not outright published, there are ways for an attacker to obtain the national identity number of the user and start authenticating on their behalf. It is also possible for the attacker to create automated scripts to simply generate a list of numbers and try them all to start many authentication sessions under the name of multiple users. A better approach is to ask for an additional identifier. With Mobile-ID, a good option is to ask for both phone number and national identity number. The Mobile-ID API verifies that those identifiers match with each other and doesn’t initiate the authentication session otherwise. With Smart-ID, a good option is to ask for national identity number and some not-so-public identifier as well. It could be a username, which the users can select by themselves, the account contract number or something else only the user knows and is convenient for them to remember and type. A useful security measure is to keep track of trusted browser instances for each user. This allows the RP to take different actions whether the user is connecting from their usual (trusted) browser or attempting to login from a previously unseen, unknown browser. In case of the latter an attacker may be attempting a phishing attack and the RP could ask for more information or alert the user. The tracking should be done with the HTTP cookie (or with similar client-side storage feature supported by modern browsers) with the content of randomly generated identifier. The status of each browser instance for the user is then tracked in the RP’s website database. The fact about placing such a cookie in the browser of the user must be declared in the public cookie policy. The browser cookie has to be set with Secure and HttpOnly flags. The scope of the cookie has to be the URL of the RP’s website. In case of a phishing attack, the proxied website will be setup on a different URL and the browser will not send the value of that cookie to the attacker’s website. Therefore, the attacker cannot pose to the RP’s website as the trusted browser. In order to manage the data associated with the tracking, each user account must have the following extra data for each browser which the user has connected from in the past: displayName — Human recognisable description of the browser, like \"Chrome on Windows\" or \"Safari on my work Mac\", etc. Simple names with tolerable errors could be generated automatically from the browser’s User-Agent header with the help of software libraries and toolkits. The RP could also allow the user to edit this field, so that the user can provide their own meaningful names. lastSeen — Timestamp, when that browser was last used by the user to connect to the RP’s website. hashedTrackingID — Hashed value of the randomly generated identifier. Length of the identifier should be at least 32 bytes. The Base64 encoded clear-text value of the identifier is placed in the browser’s cookie and the hashed value is stored in the database. Storing only hashed values makes the database leak less dangerous. Salting hashes, a common practice when when storing passwords, is not required, because trackingID is already long enough with random bytes and additional protection against brute-forcing is not essential. trustLevel — Information about whether that browser instance could be considered trusted or not. Proposed algorithm uses values \"seenOnce\", \"seenTwice\" and \"trusted\". The RP could use more levels if required. Note that in case multiple users are using the same browser instance then the same hashedTrackingID value will be stored for multiple user accounts. Care must be taken to lookup the correct record, based on the user account, which is starting the authentication. A general algorithm to keep track of the browsers and to manage the trustLevel is described below. When the user navigates with the browser to the RP’s website and requests the Smart-ID authentication, the following cases are possible: If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is not known (i.e. the browser didn’t send the cookie value or the cookie value doesn’t match any value of hashedTrackingID in the user’s account) and the user doesn’t have any other browser’s trustLevel as \"trusted\", proceed with the authentication as usual. After the successful authentication, the RP should update the browser’s trustLevel as \"seenOnce\". If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is not known and the user already has at least one other browser as \"trusted\", then the situation indicates a possible phishing attack. The RP should perform additional checks and controls. If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is \"trusted\", then the RP should proceed with the authentication. The situation indicates somewhat lower risk and the RP could decide not to execute some security measures, which are required otherwise, for example, asking the user to enter multiple identifiers. After successful authentication, the RP should update the lastSeen timestamp. If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is \"seenOnce\", then the RP should proceed with the authentication as usual. After the successful authentication, if the lastSeen timestamp was older than 24 hours, the browser’s trustLevel will be updated as \"seenTwice\". If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is \"seenTwice\", then the RP should proceed with the authentication as usual. After the successful authentication, if the lastSeen timestamp was older than 24 hours, the browser’s trustLevel will be set as \"trusted\". The described algorithm can be implemented and silently deployed by the RP without any additional security measures or checks actually performed in the first phase. Those browsers, which are regularly used by users, will eventually move to the \"trusted\" classification. In the next phase, additional security measures could be put into place and when the new connection is being made from an unknown browser, additional security measures will kick in and protect users. The following sections describe such additional security measures. When the RP detects that a user has started authenticating from a known browser, the RP could withhold the requirement to ask for multiple user identifiers. Good simplification is to only require one identifier, such as the username of the user. After the username is entered on the RP’s website, the RP can lookup the user’s account information from the internal database and then initiate the Smart-ID authentication with the national identity number. However, when the RP detects the user has started an authentication session from an unknown browser, while he usually connects to the website from a different browser, the RP can ask for additional details from the user, to verify that it is indeed the user who is starting the authentication. Such details could be to the national identity number or something else, which the user knows, but the attacker might not know. When the RP detects that a user has started authentication from an unknown browser, while he usually connects to the website from a different browser, the RP can use the longer displayText and send an alert to the user. The alert would be sent in the same authentication session request as usual, but it will be displayed on a separate screen to the user during the authentication consent dialog. The RP could use a message, such as: \"Authentication started from an unknown browser. Are you using a new computer?\", or \"It seems that you are not using your regular browser. Are you using a new computer and are you sure that you are on the correct website www.example-rp.com?\" or something similar. The message will be displayed on a separate screen from the usual PIN1 entry dialog and the user will be asked to either confirm or cancel. In case the user is really connecting from a new computer and is aware of this, they can press \"Confirm\". The authentication then proceeds, the user can enter PIN1 and the user’s browser will be logged in to the user’s account. However, if this comes to the user as a surprise and the user is actually using their regular computer, the user can press \"Cancel\" and investigate further. When a user connects to the RP’s e-service, either with a browser or with the RP’s app, it connects from the IP-address of the user’s device. In case an attacker makes the connection by itself or in case the attacker proxies the connection, the RP will see the attacker’s IP-address. There are commercial services, which provide the general information about IP-addresses. For example, they can tell if the IP-address is known to be used for the following: Sending spam messages, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP-address might be using a compromised computer. Is known to be an open HTTP proxy host, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP-address might be using a compromised computer or that the attacker is using this host to proxy their connection to the RP’s website. Is known to be used as a TOR exit node or an anonymising VPN service, which may indicate that the attacker could be using this to hide their connection to the RP’s website. Is known to be an IP-address of a hosting provider, data-centre or content delivery network. This may indicate that the requests coming from such IP-addresses are used to perform denial of service or data mining attack. In addition to such commercial services, the RP’s own incident resolution team or security monitoring team could provide a list of IP-addresses that are related to known incidents or suspicious activities. The following sections describe possible actions to take when there’s suspicion of an attack. RP can use the longer displayText and send an alert to the user. RP could use a message text, such as \"Authentication started from an IP-address with open proxy service. Are you sure that you are on the correct website www.example-rp.com?\", or something similar. The message will be displayed on a separate screen from the usual PIN1 entry and the user will be asked to either confirm or cancel. There could be legitimate reasons why the user is using such IP-address or VPN service and if the user is aware of this, they can press \"Confirm\". However, if this comes to the user as a surprise, the user can press \"Cancel\" and investigate further. In case the source IP-address is used to send many authentication requests and there’s suspicion that a denial of service attack is in progress, RP can perform additional verification on the browser with a CAPTCHA. This can slow down the attackers and forces them to change their scripts and tactics. In case the source IP-address is associated with a previous fraud case and is known to be malicious, the RP can block this connection and deny service. The RP must first record enough information about connections and operations users regularly attempt on the RP’s website. It is then possible to apply log analysis and other security intelligence to the available information (and cross-reference with other data sources) to deduce with some certainty: there is an ongoing attack; some source (IP-address, browser, phone number, e-mail address) behaves in a weird way and perhaps should be more closely monitored or added to the list of suspicious IP-addresses or malicious IP-addresses; some logs might indicate that there’s an unknown vulnerability in the RP’s website. Procedures to respond to fraud and security incidents must be developed and communicated and practiced within the RP organization. When it is known that the RP responds quickly to attacks and attackers are caught by the law enforcement it also acts as a deterrent to future attackers. The RP must be familiar with services and guidelines from law enforcement authorities and other bodies. It is useful to establish contacts with these organisations before the urgent need arises. Good opportunity to do that is to participate in exercise sessions with the local cyber defence league unit. Some security measures described in this document require processing additional data about users (for example, which IP-addresses they have used) and require placing additional information on their browser cookies. This means that the RP must re-evaluate their personal data processing guidelines and public policies. For using cookies a cookie consent must be asked from the data subject and the information about using such cookie must be declared in the public cookie policy. For processing personal data the RP must make sure that they have a lawful basis for doing so (see GDPR art 6(1)). In case the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. It is also useful to review the RP’s privacy policy and update it with relevant information.","title":"Secure Implementation Guide","component":"rp-api","version":"3.0.0","name":"secure","url":"/rp-api/3.0.0/secure.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The first three are POST requests that return a sessionID and the fourth used is a GET used to query for the result based on the sessionID. The authentication session is used to log a user onto a system or otherwise verify the identity of a user; the signing session is used to to create digital signature; the certificate choice session is used immediately prior to the signing session when the User’s signing certificate is required to create the object that will be signed; finally, the session status endpoint provides the result of the above sessions. This solution is still work-in-progress and has not been finalized yet. Push notification based flows do not link the location of the Smart-ID app to the location of the RP page/app (that the user is authenticating to) in any way. This means that attackers can launch remote authentication requests for unsuspecting users. They can combine these push requests with phone calls or emails, convincing users to complete an authentication for them. They can also launch a large number of requests, trying to exhaust the user and let them enter their PIN to get rid of the notifications. The main benefit of the new dynamic link based flows is that they solve this problem by helping to ensure that the location of the Smart-ID app coincides to the physical location of the RP page/app. Maximum security would be attained by making the dynamic link based flows mandatory. However, this solution might be deemed not reasonable by RPs and might face initial pushback from end users (at least until they have gotten used to it). On the other hand, if the authentication flow method would be up to the user to choose (dynamic or notification-based), then this could easily be exploited by the attackers to continue sending out the remote authentication requests for unsuspecting users, as has happened previously. The way to obtain simultaneously optimal security and optimal user experience is to: Require dynamic link based login for the user for every new device that he uses; Allow for subsequent requests from the same device to be done in either way (dynamic or notification-based). It would be up to RP to decide how long this would be allowed for until they must re-validate using a dynamic flow (the recommended validity time window is 7-30 days (depending on RP security model), the longest allowable is 90 days). For the same-device use case (Web2App and App2App), the new dynamic flows provide both enhanced security and user experience; thus, it is recommended to always use the new flows on the mobile device. However, push based flows are still available as previously, if deemed necessary by the RP (after the user has completed the dynamic link based flow at least once on that device). Technically, this would be enabled by the use of tokens (called deviceProximityEnforcedToken). Whenever an RP makes a request to one of the dynamic link based flows (QR / Web2App / App2App), it can request for the token deviceProximityEnforcedToken. It is returned in the session status response upon successful transaction completion. The RP must then provide this token for any subsequent request made to the notification-based endpoints. The security provided by the token mechanism is only achieved when implemented correctly by the RP. The token must be stored by the RP in a manner that is tied to the given user and device (or preferably, tied to the RP browser/app). For example, it may be saved in a cookie on the user’s browser for the RP webpage or app storage of the RP app. Whenever an attacker tries to initiate an authentication session on behalf of a user, they will do so from a computer that does not have the token, which will trigger a stronger form of authentication, protecting the user against the attack. The token is only valid for that single user and can not be used with other users. In case of a token leak, the users will be able to revoke all of their tokens, similar to a \"Forget me on all devices\" functionality. The token-based approach only provide the base minimum level of security; it is up to RPs to decide if they want to adopt a stricter policy or not. For example, RPs might instead: Require dynamic links for every transaction. Require dynamic links at beginning of every session. Whenever there is anything suspicious or requiring a stricter authentication, ask for a dynamic link based authentication/signature. The exact validity of the token will be configurable for each RP in the Smart-ID system.","title":"Session types","component":"rp-api","version":"3.0.0","name":"sessions","url":"/rp-api/3.0.0/sessions.html","titles":[{"text":"Security model for accessing sessions","hash":"_security_model_for_accessing_sessions","id":1},{"text":"Technical details of the solution (device proximity enforcement tokens)","hash":"_technical_details_of_the_solution_device_proximity_enforcement_tokens","id":2}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"Session status endpoint Method URL GET BASE/v3/session/:sessionId Session status query parameter Parameter Type Mandatory Description timeoutMs integer Request long poll timeout value in milliseconds.

The signature protocol ACSP_V1 is used for authentication requests and RAW_DIGEST_SIGNING signature protocol for signing. Authentication Context Signature Protocol version 1 makes the signature non-replayable by adding a server-side component to the signed object. The RP must provide the digest algorithm to use as well a challenge it needs signed. The challenge must be generated anew for every single authentication request. It must be remembered by the RP for the duration of the authentication session, and later it is used to reconstruct and validate the signed authentication data structure. The recommended way of generating the challenge this is to use the Java SecureRandom class[1] or equivalent method in other programming languages, to generate a random value for each new authentication request. For example, the following code snippet generates 64 random bytes and computes the hash value and encodes it in Base64. SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom(); byte randBytes[] = new byte[64]; random.nextBytes(randBytes); MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-512\"); md.update(randBytes); byte[] hash = md.digest(); byte[] randomChallenge = Base64.encodeBase64(hash); The value of the randomChallenge must be recorded in the current user’s session for later comparison.

Not all client applications have yet been upgraded to the latest versions that support RSASSA-PSS. Therefore, the Smart-ID service may return a signature created using the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature scheme even if the RP client requested RSASSA-PSS.

HTTP error code 403 - Relying Party has no permission to issue the request. This may happen when: Relying Party has no permission to invoke operations on accounts with ADVANCED certificates. Relying Party has no permission to use requested capability. HTTP error code 404 - object described in URL was not found, essentially meaning that the user does not have an account in Smart-ID system. Dynamic link based flow signature request parameters Parameter Type Mandatory Description relyingPartyUUID string + UUID of Relying Party. relyingPartyName string + RP friendly name, one of those configured for particular RP. Limited to 32 bytes in UTF-8 encoding. certificateLevel string Level of certificate requested. ADVANCED/QUALIFIED/QSCD, QUALIFIED. requestProximityEnforcedToken boolean If true, token deviceProximityEnforcedToken will be returned in the session status response. This token indicates that the proximity enforcement has taken place and enables the subsequent use of the notification-based flows for that user and device for a pre-configured time period. Default is false, token is not generated nor returned. signatureProtocol string + Signature protocol. Describes the signatureParameters object. Currently the only allowed value is: * RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE - scheme where user-provided digest is signed directly (similarly to RP-API v1 and v2). For more details see section RAW_DIGEST_SIGNING. signatureParameters object + An object describing the parameters for the signature algorithm. Its structure depends on the signatureProtocol used. See RAW_DIGEST_SIGNING parameters table. allowedInteractionsOrder object + See section available interactions. nonce string Random string, up to 30 characters. If present, must have at least 1 character. requestProperties object A request properties object. See section IP sharing. capabilities array Used only when agreed with Smart-ID provider.
